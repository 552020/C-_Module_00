### Exercise 00: Megaphone

This exercise is a warm-up to discover I/O in C++.

**Functioning**

The goal of this exercise is to develop a `to_upper` with a specific behavior if launched without any parameters.
It must be solved with a C++ approach (string/upper).

### Exercise 01: My Awesome Phonebook

This exercise is a first approach to writing a simple class and using it in an interactive program.
If the exercise does not work perfectly, note what can be improved.

**Error Management**

There is a bit of error management to do in this program, but the behaviors are not specified in the topic. Exiting the program properly or managing errors is okay. A segfault is not! :D

**EXIT Command**

Rate the EXIT command based on what is requested in the topic.

**Visibility**

The attributes of the `Contact` class must be private. The class should expose the corresponding accessors. Also, ensure that everything used only within a class (and not just the `Contact` class) is private, and the rest is public. Beginners tend to make everything public. That's what you need to check here.

**The `Contact` Class and the `Phonebook` Class**

The code must include a `Contact` class (or another name).
The class must contain the requested attributes.
The code must contain a `Phonebook` class with an array of Contacts inside.

**Read/Eval Loop**

The program should offer a sort of read/eval loop:
Read then process input, then wait for new input until receiving an EXIT command.
The loop should be done in a C++ way (std::cin)!

**ADD Command**

Rate the ADD command based on what is requested in the topic.

**SEARCH Command**

Rate the SEARCH command based on what is requested in the topic. A slight divergence in the expected format is not important. This part aims to use C++ "iomanips," and that's what you should focus on.

### Exercise 02: The Job of Your Dreams

The goal of this exercise is to retrieve information hidden among the noise and to insert code into an existing context.

**Did You Save the World?**

This exercise is rather simple. Either `Account.cpp` works, or it doesn't. Compare the program's output with the provided log file.
Any difference (except for timestamps or the order of destructors) means the exercise is incorrect.

### Ratings

Don't forget to check the flag corresponding to the defense.
